## Work in Progress

This project is currently being refactored from a prototype (hard-coded HTML in `Program.cs`)  
into a proper **ASP.NET Core MVC** application with Razor views, controllers, and a cleaner architecture.

### Completed so far
- ✅ Added `HomeController` + `Index.cshtml`
- ✅ Created `GarageViewModel` for Razor binding
- ✅ Updated `_Layout.cshtml` and `site.css` with OU-themed styling
- ✅ Preserved original prototype under `/prototype`

### Next steps
- 🛠️ Clean up old Student Portal views
- 🛠️ Move inline styles to dedicated CSS
- 🛠️ Add screenshots and deployment instructions
